# eCommerce App for Crochetness

I am creating an eCommerce App for a teenage entrepreneur who crochets outfits (mainly dresses). I love her work because it's a modern take on a very old-school concept, so I offered to create a website for her. 

## User View
The landing page, the shopping page (with filters), and the product pages
Shows pictures and users can favorite and click to order and put into the their cart!

## Admin View
I want Jaclyn to be able to upload her new work!

## Front End Routes within the User View

1. Home
2. About My Store
3. Products Previews
4. Shopper Reviews

5. Shopping

* Store page 
* Product Page

## Later Features
1. Users can submit reviews
2. Users can add pictures of themselves in the clothes on Instagram

## General React stuff I might need later

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
